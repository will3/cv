### Work History

#### Vista Entertainment Solutions (2012-2016)  
**Lead iOS developer**  

Vista creates software for the cinema industry ranging anything from online ticketing, point of sale to air conditioning. I was one of the first mobile developers hired by Vista and was involved in several green field projects and expanded the mobile product suite. The team has since grown to a size of 8 and I have worked closely with other developers, testers and designers in an agile team.

##### Responsibilities:

- Implement new features, work closely with designers and adopt modern UI designs
- Respond to customer bugs and requests, assist in release processes (App store and Enterprise distribution)
- Shape code architecture, introduce new patterns and frameworks
- Maintain continuous integration, simplify deployment process

##### Projects:

- **Vista UsherPoint** (iOS, for cinema staff)  
Used for scanning bookings in the lines and crowd control. This is my first green field project in Vista. While working closely with the stackholders, I was able to quickly build a prototype and present it to potential customers. As a result, a major cinema chain has bought the product, and it is now used by several more.  

- **Vista Mobile Cinema** (iOS & Android, for movie goers)  
In this project, I was involved in building a ticketing app to replace an existing, outdated version. This gave me the opportunity to adopt new technologies and modern UI practises. I also built an internal tool for customers to customise and brand the app, which greatly simplified the deployment process. As a result, Vista sold the app to over 20 cinema chains and this number is still growing.

#### Cycles Research Institute (2009-2011)  
**Research Assistant**  
Data analysis / plotting tool, for analysing cycle data.
