**Apps**:

- Vista UsherPoint (March 2012 - )  
[https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/vista-usherpoint/id642694108](https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/vista-usherpoint/id642694108)  
UsherPoint is an iOS app for cinema staffs to help with crowd control, session times and messaging managers. it is currently used by over 2000 cinema staffs (Regal, Cineplex).  
Working closely with the product director, I built fast prototypes and presented to potential customers. As a result, I was offered a full time position to lead the development of the project. Over the years I was responsible for maintaining and building new features for the product.  
Some technologies used were barcode scanning, external hardware integration (LineaPro, Honeywell), push notifications and real time messaging.  

- Vista InTouch (Nov 2012 - )  
[https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/vista-intouch/id642693317](https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/vista-intouch/id642693317)  
InTouch is a companion app for UsherPoint, it is used by cinema managers to manage cinema staffs.  
I was involved in rewriting the UX and building the backend using .NET and SQL Server. I also built a push notification / messaging service to facilitate real time messaging between InTouch and UsherPoint. Over the years, we've added functionalities such as seat swap, stock take and location checks.

- Vista MobileCinema (July 2013 - )  
[https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/vista-mobile/id882981768](https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/vista-mobile/id882981768)  
MobileCinema is a ticketing app for cinema goers.  
A rewrite of an out-dated 3rd party app, I worked with another Android developer and wrote a modernized version for both platforms. The team has since grown to 8 members and I was responsible for driving and building new features, and mentoring junior / new developers.  
Some features include push notifications, passbook integration, WeChat / AliPay integration, AppPay integration, loyalty member integration and  Movie / trailer ratings.
